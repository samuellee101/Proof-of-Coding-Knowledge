All programs were run on replit.com
However, all programs should run in Visual Studio, please ensure that whatever IDE you are using, that all five .csv files are included.

These are:
album-instrument.csv
album.csv
instrument.csv
musician-album.csv
musician.csv

Please run task.py first. This is so that the database 'Notown-Records.db' is created, which is used in order to run the summary.py program.

**ACHTUNG**
If using replit, as of 4/27/23 (April 27, 2023) you MUST rename whatever program you are running to main.py in order to successfully run that program on replit.

For example, first rename task.py to main.py and then run this program.
Please do the same for summary.py.
