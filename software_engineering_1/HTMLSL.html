            Hello professor, I am Samuel Lee, I am twenty-two years old, and I actually have two different possible career goals I wish to
            work towards. The first would be working for a outer space company such as SpaceX, who I've wanted to work for forever. The second
            goal is to move to Germany. Because these two goals are quite conflicting, I will have to see which career goal is more feasible
            and objectively better for my career path. I am interested in this class because I wish to become a software engineer, which is a
            profession that is heavily desired in both the United States and Germany, and I will find (relatively) easier employment than other
            possible careers.
